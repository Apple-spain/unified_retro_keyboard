# Franklin Ace-1000 keyboard

This keyboard was contributed by Chris Ryu.  His orignal project is at https://github.com/ryucats/Franklin-ACE-1000-Keyboard/tree/main

The original design has been modified in the following ways:

- Uses the dual footprints for futaba / cherry keys.
- include a diode for every key.
- Add stabilizers to the spacebar
- The Franklin keyboard is 9u, but it's very hard to find a 9u option. Instead, use 8u+1u
- Add cherry and futaba aligner plates
- Replace the LOCK key with a 1.75U key with LED window. Fix LED spacing to match original.
- Create a spreadsheet with a specification for a keycap set.
