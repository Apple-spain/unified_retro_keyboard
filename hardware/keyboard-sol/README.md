# SOL keyboard

This keyboard replicate the keyboard on the SOL-20.

The keyboard is designed using KiCad in order to be the most useful for anybody
wishing to modify the keyboard for more specific uses, or to add to the project.

The keyset for the SOL-20 keyboard consists of the Unified Keyboard Project
classic ASCII keyset, with a special SOL-20 add-on keyset.

## Differences from the original include:

1. The original keyboard is a capacitive keyboard. This keyboard uses standard
   switches (either Cherry or Futaba). The Futaba keys approach the original
   feel, but there is a difference.
   
1. The original keycaps have an 11 degree angled stem. It may be possible to
   find such keycaps, or to create an 11-degree adapter, but I was unable to do
   so, so this keyboard was tested with straight keycaps. I have tried both, and
   do not find a difference in typing comfort or speed, althought there is an
   aesthetic difference. There is s tiny bit of space between keys using
   straight keycaps, so an 11 degree adapter may not require any change to the
   layout.
